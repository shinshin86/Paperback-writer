When the winter comes, She will go to the "Sleeping".
It is never exaggerated. This is true.

Actually, When the winter comes, She's lifestyle is change.
She wake up a daytime of twelve o'clock, When finished brush her teeth that she cook a simple morning(or Lunch). And it eat very slowly.
Then drink a plain two cups of hot water after a meal. Of course very slowly.
And a take a shower (There is also a day that she also does not sometime bathed),
Then she brush a teeth, And fall asleep again until the day of the twelve o'clock the next day.

She has been active in one day that time of about an hour. It carefully.
If exist a "What sleep time ranking" that might be her name is ranked. In second followed by Sleeping Princess.

I began dating her early spring. And we began to live together by the end of the summer.
"I have to tell you"
Came the autumn. when then came a the first cold wintry wind, she said with a serious look.
"When the winter comes, I sleep long long time. Like a illness."
I was listen to a she's talk with drink of hot cocoa that she made to me.
And how i can interpret a her word that sit across from table that was thinking to full operation.
